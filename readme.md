# Mockster3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rtens/mockster3.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rtens/mockster3)

This is a fork of *mockster* - a full-fledged, zero-configuration [mocking] framework for PHP.

This fork provides the same API as the [original project], but under a different names space (`rtens\mockster3`), 
so it can be used alongside with version 2.5. 

Please refer to the [original project] for any information.
